# Cansat_pcb_esp_opt1
This project involves designing a custom PCB for a CanSat — a small, satellite-like system built inside a soda can–sized structure. The board integrates an ESP32 microcontroller, LoRa module, microSD card slot, and camera interface, enabling onboard data logging, image capture, and long-range wireless communication.
